Alberta Bow River Basin: Flow, Reservoir Storage & Water Level Data (\#yycflood)
========

### Summary

This R analysis pulls river flow and height data from Alberta Environment, and generates a plot for both the Bow & Elbow rivers showing flow-rate trends and normalized water levels (relative to pre-flood levels).
It also pulls reservoir water level and storage volumes from dam controlled reservoirs / lakes.
