Alberta Bow River Basin: Flow, Reservoir Storage & Water Level Data (\#yycflood)
========

### Summary

This R analysis pulls river flow and height data from Alberta Environment, and generates a plot for both the Bow & Elbow rivers showing flow-rate trends and normalized water levels (relative to pre-flood levels).
It also pulls reservoir water level and storage volumes from dam controlled reservoirs / lakes. 

### River Flow, Water Level, and Reservoir Storage Plots

**Note:** Real-time data is subject to revision.
(I have no idea as to how accurate this data is, but thought it might be interesting given the current situation!)

### Example of Glenmore Reservoir Flow:
I've also put together a quick example of Glenmore Reservoir flow with some gross assumptions, but I was trying to get an appreciation of what happens when there is significant upstream precipitation / snow melt.
